  <h1>Eight and Eighty</h1>
  <p>If there exists something called responsibility, then you're absolutely responsible and answerable to two individuals during your lifetime. Your eight year old self and your eighty year old self.



    <p> Engaging in pursuits that make others happy or please them or are helpful to them is not being responsible. If you have to take ownership of keeping someone satisfied (if there ever exists such a state of being), it' you. To enable your actions, behaviors and emotions to work in a way that it satisfies the eight year old you; full of dreams, knowing nothing of the word impossible, observing everything new with ever-so-increasing curiosity and questioning every single atom of the world's existence- tangible and intangible; and the righty year old you; breathing with a far more relaxed state of mind, having clear assignment of priorities and values in life, reminiscing of the past more often than you thought you would.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The eight and eighty is a mere symbology to refer to the younger, dreamer you and the older, just before doom you. It is not so much as the age quantum that matters here but the state if mind, the stage if life that I intend to refer to. If I cannot be answerable to these two self states of my being, I'm pretty sure nothing else in the world would matter as much. There are only so many things that bestow me (and most other humans) something higher than happiness- Eudaimonia. The true potential of one's values.</p>
    
    
    
<p>I do not remember my exact state of mind when I was an eight year old or a ten year old or a twelve year old for that matter. But like I said earlier, it's not about the numeric here it's about the permanent memory of the younger you that lives in your heart and mind inherently, exclusively. I remember being an obedient child. Amidst a joint family with minimum twenty people in the house at any given point in time, I was happy to follow instructions, orders, comply to requests and even avoid activities that I was warned against. For most part. For the remainder, I dreamt of flying. I literally dreamt of flying. I still have this dream very often. It's always a similar vibe with the exception of subtle changes in the landscape and my hair style (always oscillating between a chic-short blunt cut or traditional- long wavy hair like that of a queen who's just had it steamed with fragrant oils and incense). In the middle of nowhere, standing on an elevated platform with my head completely turned upwards , looking into the hazy, blue sky I smile and take a long, deep breath puffing out the air so as to make my body lighter. I jump up and am not pulled down by gravity. I'm levitating. I hop around in the air as if running on the ground and can feel the wind in my face. I'm in love with this dream. This is a connotation to the wild spirit within me that wants to be free more than anything else. 
    
    Wild spirit does not imply I want to go on adventurous trips around the world every second month (though I sometimes think of trekking in the Himalayas. I might actually do it sometime!) but the wildness of thought, action and behavior. I did not want to be restricted so much so that I felt bad for being the hopelessly obedient kid while my other cousins could have so much fun being naughty and conjuring excellent novel tricks and games. I would be a part of it, extremely selectively though, but always ended up telling myself "Once I'm a bit older, I would certainly act on my instincts alone. Period."</p>
    
    
    
<p>Amidst the motley mix of traits and habits that I possess, a mere few have blended with my spirit flawlessly. Empathy, faith and kinesis.</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Empathy. I amount to nothing if I'm not kind. Being kind doesn't mean I speak to people with a bunch load of sugar in my speech. It means, I always (even in the most criminal situations) find a reasoning for an action committed or emotions expressed. I might not endorse it, I might not agree to it but I always find a way to understand it. That's the only way I can deal with it. Whether the actor is me or any other biota of this planet.</li> 
    
    
    <li> Faith. I have invested all my energy in a mask called faith. When I call upon it, it's faith and when I harness it, it's energy. It does not lie with any individual (alive or dead) or with a supernatural power or symbol. It lies within the emotions I harbor. </li> 
    
   <li>Kinesis. The only constant is change. If I might add to it: 
    The only constant is change and only change can exponent your constant. 
    I haven't considered kinesis in the literal terms. If I were to replace it with a word from the vocabulary of my mother tongue Hindi, I'd call it Pravaha. Being in flow, always. </li> 
</ul>

   <p> Everything that I inculcate as a good habit or thoughtful action is merely a natural metamorhpsis of one of these or a mix of these three. And that's how I hope I'd be able to keep it until the eighty year old me takes form.
    
    The last stage of life, however peaceful or daunting it might be, will definitely reminisce the life lived. I do not know if one is truly capable of being truly happy or truly sad in the moment before breathing out the last molecule of CO2.  But I believe I will certainly look at the life I lived with eyes filled with either sweet or sour tears. And I would be closest to the happiest state possible if those are sweet tears rolling down over a smile.
    
    In the final moments, to realise that I acted on those lifelong wishes, experienced those ecstatic moments and worked on the problems I really wanted to solve will be like sitting across from her, holding her frail, wrinkled hands in mine and telling her why all that she withstood during her life shouldn't pain her anymore. Why she can now credit the good memories to the hardships that she lived. And why it was so important to not give up even a zeptosecond earlier than this moment at hand. It can all be worth it afterall. Despite all the failures experienced, the disappointments delivered, and the mistakes made.</p>
    
    <p>It's easier said than done- Just make yourself happy. Everyone else doesn't matter. We love some (or many) people in our lives- our parents, our friends, our partners, our kids, our pets, etc. We want to make them happy too. We definitely want them to be satisfied in their lives too. And if we can do something to make that possible, then of course we want to do it!
    And by all means, please do it. It does bring in joy, satisfaction and happiness in our own lives too. But if I could make only two people proud and no more, I'd choose the eight and eighty year olds me. One has looked upto me for as long as it breathed and the other has endured a myriad of pains to give me all the breaths she could. To let them down would be to not know what proud means.</p>
