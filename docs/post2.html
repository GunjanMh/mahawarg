  <h1>Stardust and Us</h1>
  <p>
    All that makes up a star is within me. Within you. The clouds you see calmly swishing across the dome of a sky, the water you see spilled-seeping into the ground, all that moves and doesn't , all that changes and doesn't, all that breathes is made up of the same thing.

    Hydrogen - The most abundant element in stars and also crucial in human bodies, primarily in water molecules and organic compounds
    
    Carbon - Produced by nuclear fusion in stars and the fundamental building block of all organic matter in our bodies
    
    Nitrogen - Present in stellar nucleosynthesis and essential for human DNA, proteins, and amino acids
    
    Oxygen - Generated in stars and vital for human life, making up much of our body's water and organic molecules
    
    Iron - Forged in the cores of massive stars and critical for human blood hemoglobin
    
    Calcium - Created in stellar processes and fundamental to human bones and cellular signaling
    
    Phosphorus - Produced in stellar nucleosynthesis and essential for human DNA, bones, and energy transfer (ATP)
    
    
    When I look up and see the stars I see something more than just the darkness and the twinkling stars. I see myself capable of being alone. Capable of being by myself and not complaining about it. There is one thing I feel awful about though. That I didn't see this before. All my childhood, even teen years were spent in a city that never really had a starry sky. Delhi was always plagued with the curse of pollution and it smogged more than just our lungs. Now when I look upto the sky I think of the young kid who did not have a chance to stargaze. I truly believe it's an activity one should absolutely do. Wherever you are, whichever part of the world the sky above you is the ultimate source of truth. I do not think the Earth to be the source of truth. It's the sky.
    
    The planet Earth is well, a planet. A planet does not outlive the universe. Not atleast as much we understand about cosmology until now. The Earth can be well shaken up , even shattered if a large asteroid/comet hits it, if the magnetic field reverses and cease to protect against solar radiation, if gamma-ray burst from a nearby supernova reaches us, or maybe we humans might just kill the planet with nuclear/biological/chemical warfare.
    
    But we rarely stand a chance to disrupt the existence of the Universe. To me, the Sky is the Universe. Anything that's up there in the Universe is also up there in the Sky. Only, we can but a very few of the elements. And even fewer with our natural, human eyes. 
    
    If I would have been subjected to these sights early in life, I wonder if I would have been able to think of anything else. Whether or not I would have been where I'm in life today is highly dubious. The times I look up at the sky, I'm absolutely singular. I have no family, no relations, no friends and no one has me. And I like it that way. If you ask me, I'd still want to fly to a land that harbours a clear view of this Universe, has just enough to house me and I'd never want to come back. 
    
    Sadly, the world we live in is superfluously divided. The borders carved by humans to split up parts of land, water, flora, fauna and even airspace are nowhere to be seen- if you see just with the natural eyes. 
    
    But here's when you need the natural-human eyes. The human in you and me will know where China ends and India begins, what Visa you need to go to your dream country, how much money you need to experience how life is on the other side of this rocky planet. You are a human, the creature for whom all this exists and probably the only one who, if he so wants, is capable of making sense of each of its elements. But it is also we who cannot go everywhere. There are rules and laws, requirements and procedures, tricks and foul plays, losses and wins, which will decide where you can and cannot go. What you will and will never see on this planet. What is truly the World and the Universe.
