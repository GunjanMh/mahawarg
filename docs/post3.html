  <h1>Felt like an idiot? Good.</h1>

    A nervous smile and a mind that has gown down an abyss trying to dig as much information as possible. Those are the two immediate after effects of the moment when I feel like an idiot. </p>
    <p>
        And moments like these have helped me learn more and grow out of the 5 things I knew about this world. It isn't so much about intentionally being engulfed in this moment but more about how often can I expect this to happen. If I seek more such moments, I'm good. I'm uncomfortable but I'm good.

        For many people a day well spent can mean different things. Having a nice meal, having spent quality time with their loved ones, having an adventurous trek in the hills or simply sitting around the fire chatting with old friends. Of course, these are days well spent for me too. Barring the adventurous trek- still trying to achieve that!

        But a significant addition to this list is “having felt like an idiot”. When I speak to someone who knows way more than I know, when I can ask stupid questions and probably feel embarrassed in the moment but end up discovering a facet of the phenomenon I never knew existed- it's moments like these that make me want to know more, read more and feed my curiosity as typically as I do my early morning hunger pangs.

        There are surely many other ways people can outgrow their old selves but I have seen the maximum progress in me post experiences like these. Initially, it used to be very dramatic. A little voice in my head would literally scream in an angry albeit sensible words about how little I know. How much more there is to work on. And why there is no time to sit and compare myself with others but instead use that time to draw inspiration from any and every person/phenomenon around me. With some experience, the voice grew less and less angry and simply resorted to always reminding me to put in some effort to maybe feel a tad less stupid the next time someone discusses that topic with me. Or better, the next time I am required to put that knowledge to use, I'm capable of relying on myself.

        If all that you're waiting for is how to get started I can suggest this method. Seek for a moment where you expect you'll feel like an idiot. Talk to an expert in the field you want to build in. Speak to the leader who has all your attentions when he/she is speaking. Connect with the founder whose journey you admire so much. If you're anything like me, these will only propel you forward. But if you're anything like me, you might also be at a loss of words or fumble simple sentences or clumsily stumble on your way in (or even out!). But hey, there's always a trade off for good things in life.
