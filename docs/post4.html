  <h1>Parents of Hierarchy</h1>
  <main>
  <p>
    What if governments didn't exist? </p>
    <p>
        Would there be more destruction or more peace? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Would the average man/woman be better off than he/she currently is or would he/she die much earlier due to hunger or lack of any other basic need? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Would the human race be more technologically advanced than its current level? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Would people have more respect for one another?
    </p>
    <p>
        Would there be no hierarchy anywhere- not in businesses, not in the houses, not in social groups?
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of hierarchy exists because it exists in the government. Some people rule over others. Some people lead others towards a larger goal. Some people command others to do something and impose the execution of these commands. Sometimes very strictly so.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wonder if there were no governments no kings no rulers ever, would we even know the concept of hierarchy? The fact that a fellow human has higher authority over you and that a tiny fraction of the entire population of a particularly land mass (country) makes rules for, implements orders for and imposes punishments on a much larger population (people of the country). Not just humans, these governing bodies also directly control the flora and fauna that grows and breeds in their respective countries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm trying to think how the first human ever to draft a governing constitution would have thought about the task. How would he have taken into consideration each element existing within the physical boundaries of its country (tangible and intangible) and thought it to be owned by someone? How would he have come up with the actual concept of ownership?

    <p>
        Did someone ever rule over the entire world, when it was in fact one landmass? 
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer is No. Pangaea existed between 299 million and 180 million years ago. The earliest humans evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. This means that Pangaea had already broken up long before humans even existed. During the time of Pangaea, the dominant life forms on Earth were dinosaurs and other reptiles.

        But when humans emerged i.e 300,000 years ago, the world looked significantly different than it does today. Here's what we know about the physical structure of the world 300,000 years ago:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Landmasses: The continents were in different positions than they are now. Africa, Europe, and Asia were connected, forming a large landmass. The Americas were still separated from Eurasia and Africa. Australia was further north than it is today.
            </li>
            <li>
                Climate: The climate was generally cooler than it is today, with periods of glaciation. Sea levels were lower, exposing more land.
            </li>
            <li>
                Civilizations: There were no civilizations 300,000 years ago. Humans were still hunter-gatherers and had not yet developed complex societies.
            </li>

        </ul>
    <p>
    Early City-States: In Sumerian city-states like Uruk and Ur (around 3000 BCE), we find evidence of kings and councils making decisions. These were likely the earliest forms of government with defined roles and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code of Ur-Nammu: This is one of the oldest known law codes, dating back to around 2100 BCE. It shows that rulers were starting to formalize rules and regulations for society.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        While history suggests a relatively organic evolution of rulers, councils, and governments, the motivations of those who govern nations today are often far from natural. Undeniably, some leaders genuinely prioritize the well-being of their people. However, their actions and behaviors are frequently more influenced by narrow personal objectives and, of course, inherent biases. The simple truth, one I try to remember constantly- “If it ain’t have biases it ain't human”. To be human is to have biases. This doesn't necessarily imply negative biases; they can be positive too. For instance, a leader who experienced extreme poverty in their youth might dedicate themselves to uplifting the poorest members of society. Similarly, an individual who frequently faced discrimination and understands its irrationality might be the very person to dismantle discriminatory systems within their country.
